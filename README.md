**Title: Malware Classification Model Deployment on AWS SageMaker**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to deploy a machine learning model trained for malware classification onto AWS SageMaker as an API endpoint. The model was trained using Lab 5.4, likely on a dataset such as EMBER 2018, which contains both malware and benign samples. The deployment involves packaging the trained model into a Docker container and deploying it on AWS SageMaker for inference.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Model Preparation:**
   - Package the trained model along with any necessary dependencies into a Docker container. This typically involves creating a Dockerfile specifying the environment and dependencies required to run the model.
   - Include any preprocessing code or feature extraction logic necessary to process the input data.

2. **Deployment on AWS SageMaker:**
   - Use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy the Docker container containing the trained model to a SageMaker endpoint.
   - Specify configuration settings such as instance type and number of instances for the SageMaker endpoint.

3. **Python Client Development:**
   - Develop a Python client that accepts an executable file as input.
   - Implement logic to extract relevant features from the executable file, possibly using libraries like `pefile` or `pyelftools` to parse the file format and extract features.
   - Use the SageMaker Python SDK or AWS SDK to interact with the deployed endpoint. Send the extracted features to the endpoint for classification and retrieve the results.

4. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Randomly select 100 malware and 100 benign samples from the EMBER 2018 dataset.
   - Utilize the Python client to classify each sample using the deployed SageMaker endpoint.
   - Calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score based on the true labels of the samples.

5. **Testing Client and Endpoint:**
   - Select one malware PE file and one benign PE file from the test dataset created during Lab 5.4.
   - Use the Python client to classify these files using the deployed SageMaker endpoint.
   - Verify that the client correctly classifies the files and retrieves the expected results.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model for malware classification on AWS SageMaker. By packaging the model into a Docker container and deploying it as an endpoint, it becomes accessible for real-time inference via a Python client. Performance benchmarking on a dataset like EMBER 2018 allows for the evaluation of the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
